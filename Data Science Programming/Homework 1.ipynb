    "### 1.    Rock, Paper, Scissors (20 points)\n",
    "This is a popular game (see here), and you must create a computer player.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game setup.** Each game round consists two turns, the first by the com-puter and the second by a human.  The computer continues playing rounds until the human chooses to quit.\n",
    "- The computer chooses one of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, but keeps its choice secret.\n",
    "- The computer asks for the human’s input.\n",
    "- The human chooses one of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, or Quit.\n",
    "- Unless  the  human  quits,  the  computer  figures  out  the  result  of  the game, as follows:\n",
    "    - Rock smashes Scissors, so Rock beats Scissors.\n",
    "    - Scissors can cut up paper, so Scissors beat Paper.\n",
    "    - Paper covers Rock, so Paper beats Rock.\n",
    "If both players chose the same, it is a draw.  The computer reports the result of this round.1\n",
    "- If the human chooses to quit, the computer reports:\n",
    "    - the number of games played, and\n",
    "    - the number of times the human won.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer’s brains.** The computer must be able to exploit some humanbiases.   If  the  human  has  played  Rock  most  often,  the  computer  shouldassume  that  he  or  she  will  play  Rock  in  the  next  round,  so  the  computer should play Paper.  If the human has played Rock and Paper equally often,and Scissors less often, the computer should assume that the human is goingto play either Rock or Paper (both equally likely) in the next round.  (What should the computer play?)\n",
    "Hence, your program should remember how many Rock, Paper, or  Scissors  were  played  by  the  human. Note  that  we  don’t  need  to remember the order in which the human chooses these; the total counts so far for each choice will be enough.\n",

Thewords should all be lower-case, and should contain only characters, digits, or underscore.

You don`t have to have a college degree to serve. You don`t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King Jr.': 1.1210329644027588, 'Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S. Lewis': 0.640590265373005, 'We all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men `after our own heart.` Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S. Lewis': 0.5708532404742603, 'I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. - Charles Dickens': 4.484131857611035, 'Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving?
